## Features

üéôÔ∏è **Microphone Monitoring**: Detects high-frequency audio (e.g., ultrasonic beacons from rogue devices) that could indicate malware communication.

üå°Ô∏è **Thermal Tracking**: Flags CPU/GPU temperature spikes that might indicate crypto-miners or other resource-intensive malware.

üõ†Ô∏è **Kernel Telemetry**: Monitors system processes and USB device insertions to detect suspicious activity.

üìß **Email Scanning**: Catches phishing links in emails by connecting to your IMAP server and analyzing URLs.

üîî **Alerts**: Desktop notifications for high-risk threats with color-coded severity indicators.

üìä **Real-time Dashboard**: Interactive GUI with real-time graphs and threat visualization.

üîí **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally‚Äîno data leaves your laptop.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Microphone access permissions
- Email account with IMAP access enabled

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RaheesAhmed/ThreatSentry.git
   cd threat-sentry
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   cargo run --release -- --help
   ```

## Usage

ThreatSentry Ultra offers both a command-line interface and a graphical user interface.

### Command-Line Interface

#### Email Monitoring

```
cargo run -- email -u your_email@example.com -p your_password -l 5
```

- `-u, --username`: Your email address
- `-p, --password`: Your email password or app password
- `-l, --limit`: Number of recent emails to scan (default: 10)

#### Microphone Monitoring

```
cargo run -- mic -d 30
```

- `-d, --duration`: Duration to monitor in seconds (default: 60)

#### Thermal Monitoring

```
cargo run -- thermal -d 30
```

- `-d, --duration`: Duration to monitor in seconds (default: 60)

#### Kernel Monitoring

```
cargo run -- kernel -d 30
```

- `-d, --duration`: Duration to monitor in seconds (default: 60)

#### Full System Scan

```
cargo run -- full -u your_email@example.com -p your_password -d 60
```

- `-u, --username`: Your email address
- `-p, --password`: Your email password or app password
- `-d, --duration`: Duration to monitor in seconds (default: 60)

### Graphical User Interface

```
cargo run -- gui -u your_email@example.com -p your_password
```

- `-u, --username`: Your email address
- `-p, --password`: Your email password or app password

The GUI provides:

1. A "Start Monitoring" button to begin monitoring
2. Real-time threat scores for each monitoring system
3. Color-coded indicators for threat levels
4. Graphs showing temperature and microphone activity over time
5. A list of detected URLs with their threat scores

## How It Works

### Microphone Monitoring

ThreatSentry Ultra analyzes audio input from your microphone, focusing on high-frequency ranges (15-20kHz) that are typically used by ultrasonic beacons. These frequencies are above human hearing but can be used by malware for covert communication.

### Thermal Monitoring

The application monitors your system's temperature using CPU usage and battery information as proxies. Unusual temperature spikes or patterns can indicate malicious activities like crypto-mining or other resource-intensive malware.

### Email Monitoring

ThreatSentry Ultra connects to your email account via IMAP, scans recent emails for URLs, and analyzes them for potential phishing threats. It assigns a threat score to each URL based on various factors.

### Threat Scoring

Each monitoring system generates a threat score from 0-100:

- 0-30: Low risk (green)
- 31-70: Medium risk (yellow)
- 71-100: High risk (red)

The combined threat score is an average of all individual scores.

## Security and Privacy

- All data processing happens locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers
- Email credentials are only used for IMAP connection and are not stored
- The application requires microphone access permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **IMAP Connection Failures**

   - Ensure your email provider supports IMAP
   - For Gmail, enable "Less secure app access" or use an App Password
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Microphone Access**

   - Ensure your application has permission to access the microphone
   - Check if other applications are using the microphone

3. **High CPU Usage**
   - Reduce the scanning frequency or duration
   - Close other resource-intensive applications
